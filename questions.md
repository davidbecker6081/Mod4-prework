Promises Questions:
1. What is .then() used for, and what is .catch() used for?
.then() is used for when resolve() is called or the promise is successful, .catch() is used for when reject() is called or the promise is unsuccessful

2. What are good use cases for Promises?
Promises are great for when you need to wait for an API request to finish to run some other code (so that you don't get into callback hell!). It is also great for when you need to wait for multiple fetch requests by using Promise.all

3. What other libraries/functions can you find that uses Promises?
AngularJS and probably many others down the road
